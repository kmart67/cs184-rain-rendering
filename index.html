			<span class="sp-1">Photo-realistic Rain Rendering in Closed 3D Scenes</span></h1>
			<h3>By Varsha Venkat, Jessica Yeh, and Karina Martinez</h3>


				<h2>Summary</h2>
				<p>The goal of this project is to implement photo-realistic rain effects
					in a 3D scene by focusing on creating streaking effect based on velocity
					of rainfall, interaction of water with surfaces based on affinity to water,
					and reflection/refraction of light through the rain fall.</p>

				<h2>Problem Description</h2>
				<p>The wide use of nature scene simulations has led to an increasing
					study in real-time rendering of virtual environments. In particular,
					rain simulation plays a vital role in virtual environments amongst
					defense and military, television, weather forecasts, advertising, video
					games, and many other fields however, its implementation often leads to
					a trade-off between how photorealistic it appears and how computationally
					fast it is rendered. This due to the complex atmospheric physical
					phenomenons of rain that cause numerous effects including but not limited
					to the different levels of rainfall that occur, puddles forming, the
					splashing of raindrops, raindrops streaming off surfaces of objects,
					light reflection, and light refraction. Hence, simulating the large
					amount of raindrops in a scene that follow these properties amounts to large
					computational calculations that may not be efficient and resourceful.
					<br><br>
					In this project, we aim to find this balance of implementing photorealistic
					rain rendering and being able to do so in an efficient amount of time.
					Our focus in this project will be on creating streaking effect of rainfall,
					simulating the interaction of water with surfaces
					based on affinity to water, and reflecting/refracting light through the
					rain fall particles to ensure we have a photorealistic rendering all while
					taking advantage of computing platform, hardware and software resources
					that will allow us to be computationally efficient when rendering these
					closed 3D scenes.

				<h2>Goals and Deliverables</h2>
				<p>In this project, our goal is to render photorealistic animations of
					rainfall in various scenes. Our <span class="sp-2">baseline goal</span> is to implement is a
					realistic rendering of rainfall in a scene with objects. Our scene will
					be a cornell box with a light source and spheres inside it. This will
					show how rain interacts with objects that it hits based on affinity to the
					material, for example, how droplets drip down the side of objects. Our
					rendering will also display how water droplets and rain streaks interact with
					light in terms of reflection and refraction. This animation would probably be a video loop.
					<br><br>
					What we hope to deliver as a <span class="sp-2">stretch goal</span> is a real-time interactive
					system where the user can adjust the density and velocity of rainfall by
					pressing keys, for example, from sprinkling to a storm. We also hope to render
					puddles, so as water accumulates in areas at the bottom of the scene, puddles
					form, and raindrops continue to interact with the puddles when they hit them.
					This would require changing the cornell box to have an additional side so the water
					doesnâ€™t fall out of the scene. If implementing puddles, this video would change over
					time as the puddles grow, and not just work as an infinite loop, which makes it more challenging.
					<br><br>
					We will measure the accuracy of the rendering in a qualitative way, by comparing our
					animations to videos of rainfall. We will be able to quantitatively measure the speed,
					and from this we can see how various implementations of rain affect speedup.
