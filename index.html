				<h2>Milestone Status</h2>
				<p>After receiving the feedback from our original <a href="proposal.html">project proposal</a>, our
          team has pivoted from our original project idea to simulating real-time
          water-drop animations in order to ensure we have a more tangible final
          project that nails down our ultimate goals of this project. By the final
          deliverable, we hope to implement:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Deformation operators that will evolve the water droplets over
              time based on surface tension and varying hydrophilic and hydrophobic
              behavior effects based on solid surface materials and contact angles.</li>
            <li>Mesh operators that will ultimately determine how water droplets interact
              with each other by performing mesh splitting and collisions for specific scenes we are rendering.</li>
          </ol>
        <p>
          <br>
          After defining all these operators, we will then be able to apply them over
          various scenes to demonstrate water-droplet and surface interactions.
          <br><br>
          In the following days, we then moved on to researching what rendering pipeline
          will be the most efficient for our project - ultimately deciding on using
          the Blender Python API to write scripts that will define our final water-droplet
          animation behaviors. We all then split up tasks to complete varying parts
          of our project, where Jessica worked on implementing a deformation operator
          based on external forces and applying mesh operations that allow the
          individual vertices in the water droplet to move, Varsha worked on
          gravity-like effects on water droplets to animate falling water droplets
          as well as collisions of water-drop vertices against planes, and Karina
          worked on creating script that initializes the Cornell box scene we will
          be using in our final deliverable when implementing water-surface interactions
          as well as creating the water material on Blender for our water droplets.

					<br><br>
          Based on our progress so far, we have reframed our weekly schedule to ensure
          that we will be able to complete our goals by the final due date:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Week of April 29: complete Milestone Deliverable and continue working
              on deformation operators (external forces, mean curvature flow, contact
              angle, and volume correction)</li>
            <li>Week of May 6: complete mesh operators (mesh splitting and collisions),
              generate multiple scenes that demonstrate varying interactions between water
              droplets and surfaces, and complete our project poster for presentations on May 10th.</li>
            <li>Week of May 13: debug our scripts to ensure our model is working as expected, complete final deliverables.</li>
          </ol>
