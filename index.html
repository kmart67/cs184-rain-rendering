			<span class="sp-1">Photo-realistic Rain Rendering in Closed 3D Scenes</span></h1>
			<h3>By Varsha Venkat, Jessica Yeh, and Karina Martinez</h3>


				<h2>Summary</h2>
				<p>The goal of this project is to implement photo-realistic rain effects
					in a 3D scene by focusing on creating streaking effect based on velocity
					of rainfall, interaction of water with surfaces based on affinity to water,
					and reflection/refraction of light through the rain fall.</p>

				<h2>Problem Description</h2>
				<p>The wide use of nature scene simulations has led to an increasing
					study in real-time rendering of virtual environments. In particular,
					rain simulation plays a vital role in virtual environments amongst
					defense and military, television, weather forecasts, advertising, video
					games, and many other fields however, its implementation often leads to
					a trade-off between how photorealistic it appears and how computationally
					fast it is rendered. This due to the complex atmospheric physical
					phenomenons of rain that cause numerous effects including but not limited
					to the different levels of rainfall that occur, puddles forming, the
					splashing of raindrops, raindrops streaming off surfaces of objects,
					light reflection, and light refraction. Hence, simulating the large
					amount of raindrops in a scene that follow these properties amounts to large
					computational calculations that may not be efficient and resourceful.
					<br><br>
					In this project, we aim to find this balance of implementing photorealistic
					rain rendering and being able to do so in an efficient amount of time.
					Our focus in this project will be on creating streaking effect based on
					velocity of rainfall, simulating the interaction of water with surfaces
					based on affinity to water, and reflecting/refracting light through the
					rain fall particles to ensure we have a photorealistic rendering all while
					taking advantage of computing platform, hardware and software resources
					that will allow us to be computationally efficient when rendering these
					closed 3D scenes.
